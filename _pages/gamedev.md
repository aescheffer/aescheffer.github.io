## [The Legend of Duck](https://schefferac2020.github.io/LegendOfZeldaWebsite/)
Video game design project by [Andrew Scheffer](https://github.com/schefferac2020) and [Christian Foreman](https://github.com/ChristianForeman) that implements the Legend of Zelda's first dungeon in addition to a custom level. For our custom level, our team implemented a duck controller. Every movement the player makes is mirrored by the duck which makes for very interesting puzzles and dangerous situations!
