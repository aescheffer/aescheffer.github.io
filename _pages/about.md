I am seeking a technical internship for the summer of 2024. Currently a Junior at [Grand Valley State University](https://www.gvsu.edu/) studying computer science, I enjoy working in technical environments through a trial-and-error problem-solving system. I am enrolled in the Frederik Meijer Honors College and am an active member of many on-campus clubs; these include Women in Computing, Women in STEM, and more listed on my profile. 

My main career interests include software design and development, virtual reality applications, visualization, and artificial intelligence; I am very open to exploring the different areas of computing to see where I can best apply and improve my skills. I am proficient in Python and Java along with being proficient in C, C++, C#, VisualBasic, and Linux operating systems.
