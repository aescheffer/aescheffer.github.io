<br>
I am an aspiring computer scientist and roboticist looking to work on interesting problems! I've just finished my undergraduate degree in Computer Science and Engineering from the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://www.engin.umich.edu/). I'm looking forward to starting a master's degree this upcoming semester in Computer Engineering with a focus in robotics. 

If interested, you can [download my resume here](../files/resume.pdf).

What I'm Doing Now
======
<br>

I'm extening my **previous summering internship at NASA JPL** throughout this school year. I'll continue working on the surface simulation stacks for the [Mars 2020](https://mars.nasa.gov/mars2020/mission/overview/) mission, the [Mars Sample Return](https://mars.nasa.gov/msr/) mission, and the soon-to-be-launched [CADRE tech demo](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/spacetech/game_changing_development/projects/CADRE). 

I'm currently **pursing a masters in Computer Engineering with a focus in robotics**. This semester, I'm enrolled in Mathematics for Robotics (ROB 501), Robotics Design Lab (ROB 550), Advanced Computer Vision (EECS 542), and Avionics, Navigation and Guidance of Aerospace Vehicles (AEROSP 584) at UofM.

I'm the previous **software lead for Michigan Autonomous Aerial Vehicles (MAAV)** and a current member. In this project team, we design, program, and test software code for a completely autonomous on-board flight system. Our team is competing in the IARC international competition this year and plans on running flight tests soon! 

I'm an advisor for the **Michigan Hackers iOS Team** after being a lead for two years. Michigan Hackers is the largest Computer Science club on campus with over 150 active members. On the iOS subteam, we work to teach, develop, and deploy iOS apps using Xcode and swift. Check out some of the cool projects we've worked on in the Projects tab!
